This project is a webcam-based painting program where a user can use a distinctively colored object (like a hand or marker tip) as a "paintbrush." The program identifies the paintbrush based on color using a region-growing algorithm (flood fill) and allows the user to paint on a canvas by moving the identified paintbrush in front of the webcam. The implementation includes detecting color regions, updating the painting, and providing interactive GUI controls for saving and displaying the artwork.
